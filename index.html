    <h1 id="bookmark2">Park Information</h1>
    <p><b>1. Mount Faber Park</b></p>
    <p>Mount Faber Park is one of the oldest parks in Singapore, with a size of 56 hectares. Originally named Telok Blangah Hill, it was renamed Mount Faber in July 1845, in honor of Captain Charles Edward Faber of the Madras Engineers, who built a narrow winding road to the summit for the installation of a signal station.</p>
    <p>Enjoy a cable car ride between Mount Faber to Sentosa Island or visit one of the lookout points in the park and gaze through the telescopes for a panoramic view of the southern part of Singapore and the southern islands.</p>

    <p><b>2. Telok Blangah Hill Park</b></p>
    <p>Connecting Mount Faber Park to HortPark, Telok Blangah Hill Park brings you close to the secondary forests in the region. </p>
    <p>It has the Forest Walk, which is a 1.3km long elevated pathway amongst the forests, as well as the Terrace Garden, which is a popular spot for wedding couples to take their photos – a picturesque destination for photographers!</p>
